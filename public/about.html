<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Born in Burlington, Ontario, I was raised both in Canada and later in Minnesota after a family move. 
  Coming to a different country and making new friends with different perspectives taught me to lean into being adapatble, conscientious and empathetic.
  Come to find out, I am actively using all of these tools while jumping into the world of design.

  Some of my best memories growing up were spent with my grandparents.
  It was with them that I had many moments during my upbringing where I would just sit and wonder, "why?" to many of life's mysteries.
  To this day, I arrive to problems with curiousity and it fuels me towards a resolution.
  Whether I am fixing a household appliance or an onboarding flow, I'm always trying to reach a goal.
</p>

<p>I was brought to the world of design through technology, and I stayed for the opportunity to create better experiences for our next billion users.
  Being able to solve problems, think collaboratively and creatively with the end user in mind brings purpose to my work.

<p>My goal is to continue to develop my user experience craft and work with a company that shares my values of helping humans live improved lives through technology.
